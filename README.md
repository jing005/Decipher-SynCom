The scripts for genome mining and synthetic community design

Background:
28 agricultural soil samples from different area from the Netherlands were screened for the suppressiveness against Fusarium culmorum (soil borne pathogen) in the wheat plant. A range of phenotypes were obtained including suppressive soils and conducive soils. Limited similarities were found in suppressive soils compared to the conducive ones according to the taxonomics profile, whereas, siderophore-related BGCs were found high correlation with soil suppressiveness.
To further decipher the mechanism of soil suppressiveness against F. culmorum, the S11 soil, the most suppressive soil, were selected to performed a dilution-to-extinction experiment. A clear transition from suppressive to conducive were obtained from dilutions (10X, 25X, 50X, 100X, 200X)
